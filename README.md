# chatBot
This will Eventually be a chatbot with many features

This is a rewrite of the orriginal base code and stuff. The code got rather messy and in such more difficult to debug and fix some things that are present as issues in the orriginal code. I will try to address them here but it will take time and when this is build new stuff will be added yet again. many many new things.
