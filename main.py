##broken
#seems to not like my code in the discordCheckMsg function
##its the part where it sets the value to the delete code.
#this then causes the delete thread to crash trying to find the shift value to go by




##problems
#unsure what will happen in a headless enviroment if the oauth hasnt been set
##if the token and you input a invalid token the first time it will continue to say invalid token for tokens that are even valid



##ideas
#possiblity of use of file io to get the information of the client token for discord and stuff.
#use regex to help format the chat (honestly not needed)


##youtube chat porition
#this will handle getting chat from youtube which will then be pushed to discord
